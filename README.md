The Beautiful Taxonomy Filters plugin is an easy and good-looking way to provide your visitors with filtering for your post types. With this you get a complete solution for adding filtering based on custom taxonomy terms/categories/tags. It will also automatically add rewrite rules for pretty looking filter URLs. It’s completely automatic, works without javascript and is based on the [WordPress Plugin boilerplate](https://github.com/tommcfarlin/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate) for a *standardized, organized and object-oriented* codebase. It uses [select2](http://ivaynberg.github.io/select2/) for pretty looking and user friendly dropdowns but will fall back to ordinary ones if javascript is not supported.
**No more horrible looking URLs or hacky Javascript solutions**

##features
* Activate filtering on any registered public custom post type.
* Exclude taxonomies you just don’t want the visitors to filter on.
* Beautifies the resulting URLs. You won’t see any /posttype/?taxonomy1=term. Instead you’ll see /posttype/taxonomy/term.
* The pretty URLs are much more SEO friendly so you'll give a boost to those filtered pages. Just remember to use canonicals where it's appropriate.
* BETA: Conditional dropdowns. Make sure your visitors never end up with empty filtered results. AJAX reloads the values in each dropdown based on previously selected values.
* Polylang compatible.
* Multisite compatible. No network settings at the moment.
* Comes with a complete functional filter module for you to put in your theme.
* Three alternatives for putting the filter modules in your theme:
  * Widgets (Also lets you "hard set" a post type for use anywhere)
  * do_action hooks (for granular control)
  * Automagic setting which will magically place the modules in your archive from thin air. Wizards at work…
* Choose from different styles for the component, or disable styling and do it yourself in style.css! Just want to tweak a style? Add your custom CSS directly on the settings page.
* Many more settings for fine-tuning the filter modules behavior:
  * A ”Clear all” link for the filter component.
  * Choose between placeholders or "show all" in the dropdowns.
  * Hide empty terms in the dropdowns.
  * Show a post count next to the term name
  * Disable select2
  * Show term description
  * Disable headings you don't want
  * More to come!
* Ability to show your visitors information about their current active filtering and control the look of this.
* Allows for custom GET parameters to be included. Extend the filter your way with maybe a custom search-parameter or whatever you like.
* Many [filters and actions](https://wordpress.org/plugins/beautiful-taxonomy-filters/other_notes/) for modifying the plugins behavior. For you control freaks out there…
